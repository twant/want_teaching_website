          <h3> Education </h3>
          <p id="indent">Ms. Want began her education at an Expeditionary Learning Outward Bound charter school in Denver, CO called <a href="http://odysseydenver.org/" target="_blank">Odyssey School of Denver</a>, where she attended elementary and middle school. She went on to graduate from Denver's own <a href="http://east.dpsk12.org/" target="_blank">East High School</a>. East's rigorous approach prepared her well to do her undergraduate work at <a href="http://www.carleton.edu/" target="_blank">Carleton College</a>, where she deepened her love of physics, computer science, and learning. She graduated in 2013 with a Bachelor of Arts in Physics degree. She went on to receive her Master of Education degree from <a href="http://www.bu.edu/" target="_blank">Boston University</a> in 2015</p>

          <h3> Teaching Career </h3>
          <p id="indent">Ms. Want began her teaching career as a 7th grade math teacher at Breakthrough Denver--Manual as a teaching intern in the summer of 2009. She went on to serve as a teaching intern at the Breakthrough Collaborative for three more summers, landing at Breakthrough San Francisco in 2010, Breakthrough Kent Denver in 2011, and Breakthrough Cambridge in 2012.</p>

          <p id="indent">In 2013, Ms. Want joined Teach for America, which afforded her the great privilege of teaching physics at <a href="http://www.fallriverschools.org/durfeehigh.cfm">BMC Durfee High School</a>. In her time at Durfee, Ms. Want has taught multiple levels of physics to 10th, 11th, and 12th graders. She particularly enjoys helping students with complex problem-solving and hands-on labs.</p>

          <p id="indent"> In 2015, Ms. Want was honored with a nomination for Teach for America's Sue Lehmann Fellowship for Teaching and Learning. Ms. Want was also a recipient of the Biogen Award for Excellence in STEM Teaching for her work to make her classroom more inquiry-based. She looks forward to deepening her understanding of an inquiry-based approach at <a href="http://www.kippaustin.org/schools/kipp-austin-collegiate" target="_blank">KIPP Austin Collegiate Charter School </a>in the 2015-16 school year. </p>
